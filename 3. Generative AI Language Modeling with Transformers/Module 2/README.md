# Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know that:

* The decor is pivotal in text generation and is the foundation for GPT, LLaMA, and Granite. It functions autoregressively when forecasting future words.
* The decoder’s operation diverges from the inference phases during the training phase.
* Retaining context while classifying text is possible by integrating transformer attention layers.
* PyTorch implementation models are similar to Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT).
* The BERT model’s job is to predict which sentence is the appropriate continuation.
* BERT’s architecture allows fine-tuning tasks like text summarization, question answering, and sentiment analysis.
* For data preparation, you should initialize a tokenizer using "get_tokenizer" and define special symbols with their corresponding indices.
* In the decoder method, the target sequence and the memory are taken as inputs, and the target sequence receives token embedding and positional encoding, like the source sequence.
* The transformer layer handles both encoding and decoding processes.
* Transformers process all text sequences simultaneously for language translation.
* Cross-attention computes attention scores between each target position and all source positions.

# Course Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve successfully completed the course and are equipped to apply the key concepts in retrieval augmented generation (or RAG), encoders, and FAISS. You are adept at applying the fundamentals of in-context learning and advanced methods of prompt engineering to enhance prompt design and can also use RAG, PyTorch, Hugging Face, LLMs, and LangChain technologies for different applications to acquire job-ready skills.

**At this point, you know that:**

* The chatbot generates responses based on the questions; however, it is challenging to generate responses for specific domains, such as the company’s mobile policy.
* RAG process involves encoding prompts into vectors, storing them, and retrieving the relevant ones to produce a response.
* The DPR Context Encoder and its tokenizer encode the potential answer passages or documents.
* FAISS is a library developed by Facebook AI Research for searching through large collections of high-dimensional vectors.
* In-context learning is a technique that incorporates task-specific examples into the prompt to boost model performance.
* Prompt engineering enhances the effectiveness and accuracy of LLMs by designing prompts that ensure relevant responses without continual fine-tuning.
* Advanced prompt engineering methods like zero-shot, few-shot, Chain-of-Thought prompting, and self-consistency enhance LLM interactions.
* Tools like LangChain and agents can facilitate effective prompt creation and enable complex, multi-domain tasks.
* LangChain is an open-source interface that simplifies the application development process using LLMs.
* The ‘Document object’ in LangChain serves as a container for data information, including two key attributes, such as page_content and metadata.
* The LangChain document loader handles various document types, such as HTML, PDF, and code from various locations.
* Chains in LangChain enable sequential processing, where the output from one step becomes the input for the next, streamlining the prompt generation and processing workflow.
* Agents in LangChain dynamically sequence actions, integrating with external tools like search engines and databases to fulfill complex user requests.

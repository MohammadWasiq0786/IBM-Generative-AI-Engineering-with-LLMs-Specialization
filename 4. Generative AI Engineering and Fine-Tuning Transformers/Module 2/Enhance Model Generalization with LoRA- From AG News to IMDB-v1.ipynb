By leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the model is initially trained on AG News, benefiting from its extensive labeled data and broad categorization capabilities. This robust foundation enhances the model’s language understanding.\n","\n","Subsequently, LoRA is used to fine-tune the model on the IMDB dataset, adapting its knowledge to the nuances of movie reviews for sentiment analysis. This two-phase process — starting with AG News and refining with IMDB data — ensures that the model is both well-rounded and specialized, achieving superior performance in sentiment analysis tasks.\n","\n","**Note: If you are already familiar with training a model on the IMDB dataset, you can run the cells and then jump to the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) section**\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","![Documents Overload](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-GPXX0Y15EN/docs.png)\n","\n","```Efficiency in parameter updates:``` LoRA introduces only a small fraction of additional parameters compared to the total number of parameters in a large model. This makes the training process faster and less resource-intensive because fewer parameters need to be updated during backpropagation.\n","\n","```Preservation of pretrained knowledge:``` By keeping the majority of the model's weights fixed and only adjusting them through low-rank matrices, LoRA helps preserve the rich representations that the model learned during pretraining. This is particularly beneficial for tasks that do not require drastic deviations from the behavior learned during pretraining.\n","\n","```Customization to specific tasks:``` Despite the minimal updates, the changes introduced by LoRA are significant enough to adapt the model to specific tasks. This lets you fine-tune large models on specialized tasks without the need for extensive retraining.\n","\n","```Reduction in overfitting:``` Because only a limited number of parameters are adapted, the risk of overfitting is lower compared to full model fine-tuning, especially when adapting to smaller datasets.\n","\n","```Scalability:``` LoRA scales well with model size. As models become larger, the relative increase in the number of parameters introduced by LoRA becomes even smaller, making it a particularly attractive option for adapting very large models.\n","\n","```Compatibility and simplicity:``` The method can be easily applied to different types of neural networks, especially those based on the transformer architecture. It doesn't require major changes to the existing architecture, which simplifies integration into existing pipelines.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9f996067-9279-42e7-8c9c-ca74e28602c1","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# __Table of Contents__\n","\n","<ol>\n","    <li><a href=\"#Objectives\">Objectives</a></li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Setup\">Setup</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Install-required-libraries\">Install required libraries</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Import-required-libraries\">Import required libraries</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Defining-helper-functions\">Defining helper functions</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Data-pipeline\">Data pipeline</a>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Tokenizer\">Tokenizer</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","    </li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#IMDB-dataset\">IMDB dataset</a></li>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Dataset-composition\">Dataset composition</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Applications\">Applications</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Challenges\">Challenges</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Train-and-validate\">Train and validate</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Data-loader\">Data loader</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Neural-network\">Neural network</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","     </li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Train-the-model-on-the-full-dataset\">Train the model on the full dataset</a></li>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Train-the-model\">Train the model</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","     </li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Low-Rank-Adaptation-(LoRA)\">Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)</a></li>\n","        <ol>\n","            <li><a href=\"#LoRA\">LoRA</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Rank\">Rank</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Understanding-LoRA-in-PyTorch\">Understanding LoRA in PyTorch</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Applying-LoRA\">Applying LoRA</a></li>\n","            <li><a href=\"#Loading-the-model\">Loading the model</a></li>\n","        </ol>\n","     </li>\n","    <li>\n","        <a href=\"#Exercise:-Apply-LoRA-to-a-different-network\">Exercise: Apply LoRA to a different network</a>\n","    </li>\n","</ol>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"84caacfa-0bb5-4791-9d94-876c9c751336","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9bd3a555-24ff-4c86-9f8a-d977105d0ccf","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Objectives\n","\n","After completing this lab you are able to:\n","\n","- Construct and train a neural network from the ground up\n","- Fine-tune a neural network in the conventional manner by unfreezing specific layers\n","- Use LoRA to fine-tune a neural network\n","- Comprehend the functions of LoRA and the reasons behind its effectiveness\n","- Save and load models that employ LoRA efficiently\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"868be775-e0f3-4846-b34e-b724857703fe","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1a5939b7-c56c-476a-afda-3fe5153340ca","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Setup\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9bf32e72-6fd3-4e10-8534-13896fe6b61d","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### Install required libraries\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"687b4472-0a92-4ff9-8dd5-fe502b776f7a","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["The following required libraries are __not__ preinstalled in the Skills Network Labs environment. __You must run the following cell__ to install them.

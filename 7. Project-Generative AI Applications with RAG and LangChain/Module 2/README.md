# Embed documents using watsonx's embedding model

### Introduction to document embedding
In the realm of natural language processing (NLP), document embedding refers to the process of converting textual documents into numerical vectors. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the documents, enabling machines to understand and process human language. Embedding models play a crucial role in this transformation, serving as the backbone for numerous NLP tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval.

### Understanding watsonx's embedding model
IBM's watsonx.ai offers powerful embedding models tailored to meet the demands of modern NLP applications. You can find more information here. These models excel at creating high-quality embeddings that can capture the nuances of language across various contexts.

### Steps to embed documents using models from watsonx.ai
1. **Preparation of data**:
* Ensure that your documents are clean and preprocessed. This involves tasks like removing special characters, normalizing text, and tokenization.
* Organize your documents into a format that is compatible with model's input requirements, typically as a list of strings or a data set.

2. **Loading the watsonx embedding model**:
* Access embedding models through watsonx.ai's API or platform interface. You will learn how to do it in the corresponding hands-on lab.
* Load the pretrained embedding model, which is optimized for generating document embeddings.

3. **Embedding process**:
* Pass the prepared documents through the embedding model.
* The model will convert each document into a fixed-size numerical vector. These vectors are dense and capture the semantic meaning of the documents.

4. **Postprocessing**:
* After obtaining the embeddings, consider normalizing the vectors if necessary.
* Store the embeddings in a suitable format, such as a database, for further use in downstream tasks.

### Applications of document embeddings
1. **Document clustering**:
* Use the embeddings to group similar documents together. This is particularly useful in organizing large document collections or creating topic-based clusters.

2. **Semantic search**:
* Implement a semantic search engine where queries are matched with documents based on their semantic similarity rather than just keyword matching.

3. **Text classification**:
* Utilize the embeddings as input features for classification models to categorize documents into predefined labels.

### Benefits of using watsonx's embedding model
* **High accuracy**: watsonx's model is designed to produce embeddings that accurately reflect the semantic content of documents, leading to better performance in NLP tasks.
* **Scalability**: The model can handle large data sets efficiently, making it suitable for enterprise-level applications.
* **Versatility**: The embeddings can be applied to a variety of use cases, from search engines to recommendation systems.

### Challenges and considerations
* **Computational resources**: Embedding large volumes of documents requires substantial computational power, especially for real-time applications.
* **Model interpretability**: While embeddings are powerful, they can be difficult to interpret directly, as the vector representation is abstract and not human-readable.

# Module Summary: RAG Using LangChain

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know: 

* LangChain uses text splitters to split a long document into smaller chunks.
* Text splitters operate along two axes: Method used to break the text and how the chunk is measured.
* Key parameters of a text splitter: Separator, chunk size, chunk overlap, and length function.
* Commonly used splitters: Split by Character, Recursively Split by Character, Split Code, and Markdown Header Text Splitter.
* Embeddings from data sources can be stored using a vector store.
* A vector database retrieves information based on queries using similarity search.
* Chroma DB is a vector store supported by LangChain that saves embeddings along with metadata.
* To construct the Chroma DB vector database, import the Chroma class from LangChain vector stores and call the chunks and embedding model.
* A similarity search process starts with a query, which the embedding model converts into a numerical vector format.
* The vector database compares the query vector to all the vectors in its storage to find the ones most similar to the query.
* A LangChain retriever is an interface that returns documents based on an unstructured query.
* Vector Store-Based Retriever retrieves documents from a vector database using similarity search or MMR.
* Similarity search is when the retriever accepts a query and retrieves the most similar data.
* MMR is a technique used to balance the relevance and diversity of retrieved results.
